### Computational Power **does not scale linearly**

- In many cases, it scales sub-linearly, and for the toughest problems logarithmically.

- How it scales depends inherently on the class of computational complexity that the problem being solved falls under.

- The best example to illustrate the significance of this is to look at classical encryption schemes, for each unit increase in the size of the encryption, the best encryption breaking algorithms require an exponential increase in computing power. This means that for per unit increase in computational power results in a logarithmic increase in the speed of  solving the problem. (very bad)

#####Introduction to BQP and BPP

Questions to be answered:

What is BQP and BPP?
Are there known problems in which quantum computers already solve faster than classical computers?
If so, how to identify such problems?

#####Lateral Topic:

Does QIP make the formulation of the solution for certain problems inherently easier without analysis? i.e. is it easier to come up with a probabilistic algorithm to solve a problem with QC as opposed to CC. Analogy would be silicon valley's model of buying their employees as much computing power as they need, as the computing power is cheaper than the cost of labour for software engineers.
